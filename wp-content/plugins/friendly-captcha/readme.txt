Friendly Captcha is a privacy-first anti-bot solution that protects WordPress website forms from spam and abuse.

== Description ==
 
Friendly Captcha is a privacy-first anti-bot solution that protects WordPress website forms from spam and abuse. 

Do you use a captcha like reCAPTCHA to keep out bots? Friendly Captcha is a powerful anti-spam service that blocks spam-bots without annoying captcha images and protects user privacy. 

== How Friendly Captcha Works ==

Friendly Captcha is a tool for preventing spam on your website. Other CAPTCHAs are a burden on your users, Friendly Captcha respects your users. 

Friendly Captcha is a proof-of-work based anti-bot solution in which the user's device does all the work. We generate a unique crypto puzzle for each visitor.

Solving it will usually take only a few seconds. As soon as the user starts filling the form it starts getting solved. By the time the user is ready to submit, the puzzle is probably already solved.

Friendly Captcha prevents spam and doesn't punish real users in doing so.

== Privacy Notices ==

= No personal information =
Our anti-bot service does not store personal data from your end users. See our Privacy Policy for End Users to learn more.

= No cookies =
